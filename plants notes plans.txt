For class imbalance:

Weighted loss function (calculate and pass in class weights to penalize the model more for misclassifying rare classes.)
WeightedRandomSampler versample rare class images
Data augmentation, Color Jitter, Cutout, Mixup

Attention mechanishm ViT
    Pathing, 16x16 pixels

    Classification head

We use a smaller pretained ViT
ViT uses fix input size: 224x224
timm, change classfier head with timm
only train the head in the first epochs, then the whole
validation: F1m confusion matrix
